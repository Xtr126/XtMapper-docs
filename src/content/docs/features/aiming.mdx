Shooting mode can be activated in two different methods.
#### 1. Using a shortcut key

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<LinkCard title="Settings > Shortcuts > Mouse Aim" href="../../settings/shortcuts"/>

#### 2. Using `~` key or right click
Click on the gear icon next to the crosshair
:::note[Apply non linear scaling]
When this option is enabled, mouse movement should be decelerated near the screen edges when aiming. This is a workaround for certain games having different pace of camera movement when pointer is near the edges (free fire is known to do this).

When shooting mode is activated, mouse left click will perform a tap where the left click is placed in the keymap editor.
