description: Documenting touchpad input modes in XtMapper.

Touchpad input was added in v2.1.1. It can be configured from settings.   
Currently two modes are supported, Direct touch and relative mode.  
In direct touch mode the touchpad acts like touchscreen allowing you to play games with touchpad conveniently, with multi-touch support.  
In relative mode a mouse is emulated from touchpad input.  
Direct touch mode is best if you already have a external mouse plugged in.  
Make sure to enable show touches from Android developer options for usability.   
If your touchpad is not working then please file a issue on GitHub with output of `getevent -pl` command on Bliss OS.
