description: Documenting Waydroid specific instructions for XtMapper.

Xtmapper works by reading input events directly from event nodes created by the Linux kernel input subsystem, for the lowest latency.  
https://docs.kernel.org/input/input.html  

This approach doesn't work for waydroid since host event nodes are not available in the waydroid container.  

Due to the [interest of the community](https://github.com/Xtr126/XtMapper/issues?q=waydroid) we worked on two solutions for waydroid.  

First a minimal wayland client that overlays the waydroid window and later a modified version of the cage kiosk wayland compositor to forward input events to XtMapper excluding waydroid.

cage-xtmapper should be the most convenient solution, however it has a minimal overhead of running another wayland compositor.  

Check the README.md in the relevant repository for instructions.
